# QuantumOCR-Scheduler
This is a utility program for Quantum Software Suite used for microfilm scanning, OCR and digitization. This is a python script to recognize jobs ready for OCR coming from Quantum Process (after annotation) and pass them into Optical Character Recognition (uses tesseract) in batch automatically overnight on QuantumOCR. Overnight batch jobs save time and effort of the Quality Control and Post Processing as OCR takes up a lot of time.
