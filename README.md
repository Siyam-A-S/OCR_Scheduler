# QuantumOCR-Scheduler
This is an enhancement of Quantum Software Suite for microfilm scanning and digitalization. This is a python script to recognize jobs ready for OCR coming from Quantum Process and finish OCR on them automatically overnight on QuantumOCR. Overnight batch jobs save time and effort of the editors as OCR takes up a lot of time.
